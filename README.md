Cryptorial The Applications Repo

Description:
Cryptorial is a beginner friendly crypto tutorial application. It will include but not be limited to many simulated things, possibly even some crypto games. There will be topics, categories and possibly even quizzes. I think the lack of, or need for education in crypto is essential. I want to create a space where everyone from the ages 5+ can learn how to be apart of the crypto and blockchain movement.
