Cryptorial The Applications Repo

Description:
Cryptorial is a beginner friendly crypto tutorial application. It will include but not be limited to many simulated things such as pages for patterns, markets, strategies, and possibly even some crypto games. There will be big picture topics, smaller indepth categories and possibly even quizzes. I think the need for education in crypto is essential. I want to create a space where everyone from the ages 5+ can learn how to be apart of the crypto and blockchain movement safely. In whatever fashion they choose.
